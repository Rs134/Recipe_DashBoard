# Web Development Project 5 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Reiad Sakoor**

This web app: **Features dynamic filtering and mapping of data from an API. Contains summary stats and multiple ways of synthesizing information.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *The average health score of the given data items*
    - *The total accumulated servings of each recipe*
    - *The median of the amount of time it takes to prepare each recipe*
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar 
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types
  - e.g., as a text input, a dropdown or radio selection, and/or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

A challenge that I had while constructing this data dashboard was trying to find the most sensible and organized way of structuring these components. I didnt want something too clutter or that overlaps other areas of the website. By prototyping and planning a design beforehand, I was able to collectively implement my ideas more efficiently and feel less overwhelmed.

# Web Development Project 6 - *Recipe Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Reiad Sakoor**

This web app: **This project adds on to the data dashboard with unique features including data visualization and previewing extra details**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it**
  - Clicking on an item in the dashboard list navigates to a detail view for that item
  - Detail view includes extra information about the item not included in the dashboard view
  - The same sidebar is displayed in detail view as in dashboard view
  - *To ensure an accurate grade, your sidebar **must** be viewable when showing the details view in your recording.*
- [x] **Each detail view of an item has a direct, unique URL link to that item’s detail view page**
  -  *To ensure an accurate grade, the URL/address bar of your web browser **must** be viewable in your recording.*
- [x] **The app includes at least two unique charts developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
  - At least two charts should be incorporated into the dashboard view of the site
  - Each chart should describe a different aspect of the dataset


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] The site’s customized dashboard contains more content that explains what is interesting about the data 
  - e.g., an additional description, graph annotation, suggestion for which filters to use, or an additional page that explains more about the data
- [ ] The site allows users to toggle between different data visualizations
  - User should be able to use some mechanism to toggle between displaying and hiding visualizations 

  
The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes
A challenge that I encountered during this implementation was working with the recharts data visualization tool. It was overwhelming to use at first because of the different components involved. However, by looking at different examples I was able to understand the structure of data visualization.
